# glide-react Playground

This small Vite app lets you test the published `glide-react` package.

Quickstart:

1. cd playground
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:5173/ (or the URL Vite prints)

Notes:
- The project uses Vite + React. It installs `glide-react` from the registry.
- If you want to test a local build instead of the published package, run `npm pack` in the library root and then `npm install ../glide-react/glide-react-1.0.0.tgz` in the playground.
